## Rough Sketch

```

/ => welcome!  link to /auth OR link to /home

/auth => login/signup (Auth0)

/home => MyGamesList, link to /game/create

/game/{roomID}

/game/join/{roomID}

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

/home
  list of all open games
    GET /player/{playerId}/games/ => DynamoDB.scan(userId, status=active)
  each one a link to start playing

/create
  store playerId (from auth0) in localstorage
  POST /games/rabble/create => roomID
  redirect to /game/{roomID}

/game/join/{roomID}
  credentials?
    /game/{roomID}
  Else, Form (nickname, )
    POST /games/rabble/{roomID}/join (playerId, playerName) => credentials
      DynamoDB.save(userId, roomId)
    credentials => localstorage

/game/{roomID}
  if not have playerID and nickname and == game playerid and nickname
    redirect to /game/join/{roomID}
  else
    render game

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
GET /player/{playerId}/games/
POST /game/rabble/create => roomID
POST /games/rabble/{roomID}/join (playerId, playerName)
POST /games/rabble/update/{gameID} => hook into game update mechanism and save state to player when game updates
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 * Server configured with dynamodb backend => write dynamodb database connector...
 âˆš Game must be created by POST request to the server to avoid "does not exist" error from backend
 * Build GET for player = {games: []}
 * Save game to player (when join? when finish? game page reads game state)

```
