# primary concerns

1. [ ✅ ] check for component-styling overlap (use BEM class convention for ease of use)
2. [ ✅ ] styles to check
   - cube
   - wall
   - front
   - back
   - left
   - right
   - top
   - bottom
3. [ ✅ ] drop component into main welcome page as overlay

- [ ] actually fix the spacing of individual bricks mobile-first. should be wall and cube only, try flex-direction or grid-spacing exchange.

## secondary concerns

4. [ ] add a timing function for giving rabble logo container a display none. (maybe include an addclass internal script, maybe just add a primary animation with a delay.)
5. [ ] add click function for giving rabblelogocontainer a display-none if user is impatient.

## tertiary concerns.

6. [ ] create a much simpler header logo of just the regular tiles, no animation
