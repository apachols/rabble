- Dictionary check happens after tiles are laid, then allows you to play ✅

- Exchange tiles pops a modal, tap tiles to select which to exchange ✅
- Blank chooser modal V2 needs a nicer UX ✅

- Show score during play ✔ (...on the board!)

- Drag rack tiles to reorder them

- Swipe to determine play direction

#### Lobby

- Create screen does not just have a button that says create
- Link to invite a friend pops share modal on mobile

### Technical requirements
