## MVP Milestone 3

### Behavioral requirements

#### Gameplay

- Show score during play (on the board)
- Dictionary check happens after tiles are laid, then allows you to play

- Exchange tiles pops a modal, tap tiles to select which to exchange
- Blank chooser modal V2 needs a nicer UX

- Tap rack tiles to play horizontally or vertically instead of keyboard
- Drag rack tiles to reorder them
- Drag rack tiles to place them on the board (how to recall tiles?)
- Drag placed tiles on the board to re-place them

- Shuffled rack order preserved on server

#### Lobby

- Recent games list has dates and opponents
- Create screen does not just have a button that says create
- Link to invite a friend pops share modal on mobile

### Technical requirements

- Better logging - debug / recover "unexpected state error"

- Better state abstraction (and name) for "word you are about to play"

- Tests for Rabble game file
