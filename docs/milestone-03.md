## MVP Milestone 3

### Behavioral requirements

#### Gameplay

- Shuffled rack order preserved on server ✅
- Tap rack tiles to play horizontally or vertically instead of keyboard ✅
- Dictionary check happens after tiles are laid, then allows you to play ✅

- Show score during play ✔ (...on the board!)

- Exchange tiles pops a modal, tap tiles to select which to exchange
- Blank chooser modal V2 needs a nicer UX

- Drag rack tiles to reorder them
- Drag rack tiles to place them on the board
- Drag placed tiles on the board to re-place them

#### Lobby

- Recent games list has dates and opponents ✅
- Create screen does not just have a button that says create
- Link to invite a friend pops share modal on mobile

### Technical requirements

- Better logging ✅

- debug / recover "unexpected state error"

- Better state abstraction (and name) for "word you are about to play" ✅

- Tests for Rabble game file
