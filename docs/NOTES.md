## TODO

- Creating a game needs a spinner...

- Apparently can call end turn from playword?

- Websocket sleep problem leads to server confusion

- Redo turn list to not show your exchange letters

- Add .env setup instructions to README

- Prevent exchange if fewer than 7 tiles in bag

- Web socket goes to sleep if tab is inactive

- https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/tutorial

- Add an integration test that checks all the turns plus the racks against the config.
